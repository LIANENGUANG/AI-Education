        "passage_text": "Kathy Ho teaches high school inside Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford (LPCH). “Sometimes I don’t like saying that I’m a teacher,” says Ho. “People get in their minds an idea of what teachers do, but that’s not really what it is here.”\n\n“Here” is room 386, where each year, about 500 LPCH patients also become students. The hospital school is free of parents, doctors, and medical procedures. It’s a place of learning. About half of Ho’s students stay for a week or less; others are there for more than a year. Most of Ho’s students will recover, which means that preparing them to return to school is an increasingly important component of care. \n\nStill, in room 386, academics don’t come first. Physical health and mental health are the priority. “If you’re scared about something and thinking only about that, there’s no way you’re going to be able to learn,” Ho says. “I’m a coach, an adviser, and a comforter, and that’s what it means to be a hospital teacher.”\n\nThere are up to 30 students at any given time in Ho’s class. She generally works with their regular teachers to get lessons and tests being used at their home schools. Some teachers don’t give the kids any assignments; they express sympathy instead. “I feel like it is a disservice to the kids,” Ho says. “They think their teachers don’t care about their schoolwork.”\n\nHo recognizes the psychological benefit of helping kids keep up with their peers (同龄人) outside the hospital. “I actually think the medicine is only a small piece for some problems,” says Julie Good, director of pain management services at LPCH. “It’s about problem-solving around what it means to have a full life. Those kids have dreams. School can keep those dreams alive by giving kids a way to learn and grow.”",

        "passage_text": "When Sonja Detrinidad opened her online shop selling houseplants, she didn’t have high hopes for it. But the opposite happened: She was flooded, shipping out 1,200 orders in June of 2020 alone. In the past year, Detrinidad sent out more than 70,000 plants. Her success is just one example of increased time at home leading to an explosion in the houseplant industry. \n\n“Plants are in fashion right now,” says Dr. Melinda Knuth, a researcher from the University of Florida. “People who live in plant-rich environments report a higher life satisfaction rating, ” she says. “Adding more nature to our environment can change our mood and how we think.” Plants can improve our state of mind in a few ways but the biggest is by decreasing our level of cortisol, the stress hormone (激素) in our body. \n\n“Students who are around plants perform better academically than students who are in a classroom without plants,” says Knuth. “This productivity also translates into the workplace for adults. Our study showed that there was a 30% decrease in sick leave for people who were in plant-rich workplaces.”\n\nIf you’re among the groups of people who are enjoying the mental and physical health benefits of surrounding yourself with plants, don’t beat yourself up if one (or a few!) doesn’t make it. “Doctors practice medicine and lawyers practice law and you should allow yourself the practice it takes to sustain a plant. Tending to plants is an exercise in patience and learning. Be invested in taking care of it, but if it dies, go get another one,” Detrinidad says.",
